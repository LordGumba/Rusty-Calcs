My project was to make a factorial calculator. This is to help people how dont understand math, to do parts of mathmatical equations. This is split into three sections, the mathamatical functions, the main function which asks for the needed function and tells the answer, and the FindFunction that finds and uses the correct function.

I cannot run the code myself, but here is a video explaining the steps that this code takes.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code, I made the program in Rust, and downloaded multiple extentions including R, Ragel-Rust, and rust-analyzer.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that helped me make my code.
* [Name not Clear](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

# Future Work

Some things I would improve if I had more timewould be...
* Stringing operators
* being able to put whole equations into the code
* add sin and cos?
